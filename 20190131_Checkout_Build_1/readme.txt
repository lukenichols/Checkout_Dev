Checkout Application User Guide

- To begin using the application, run the quick setup and start the application.

Application Controls:

- Press 'o' to update the offers in the application.
- Enter an item code when prompted to start adding to your shopping basket.
- Enter an item quantity when prompted to confirm adding the item to your shopping basket.
- When you are done shopping, press 'c' to go to the checkout.
- Press 'q' to quit and press 'r' to restart.

Notes:

- Updates to the offers only last whilst your iteration of the application is running, there is no permanent storage for changes.
- I am used to developing c# web applications so I haven't had much experience writing anything using the command prompt.
- The use of no database/interface makes the application simple but rigid.
